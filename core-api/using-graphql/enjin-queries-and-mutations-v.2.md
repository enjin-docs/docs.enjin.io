# Enjin Queries & Mutations (V.2)

V.2 schemas are now available as a beta feature!

{% hint style="info" %}

### Enjin Queries

Querying is the way to ask for data, itâ€™s similar to the GET action in REST-based APIs.

Here is a list of the Enjin object types you can query through the API:

* **AuthProject:** Use this query to obtain the unique access token of your project.
* **EnjinTokenEvent:** Use this to query the token events that have been recorded by the Enjin platform.

You can find comprehensive information about what data can be queried and mutated using these Object Types in the [**GraphiQL Documentation Explorer**](https://jumpnet.cloud.enjin.io/graphql/playground)**.**

To find it, go to the [**GraphiQL visual interface**](https://jumpnet.cloud.enjin.io/graphql/playground) and click the `Docs` button on the sidebar.

### Querying Variables

You may notice in our documentation, we provide examples of our queries and mutations that you can use and they will often contain variables within them. You can query these variables by simply passing through the data in the `Query Variables` section at the bottom of the page.

Simply slide up the bottom bar (Query Variables) and begin inputting the variables and their respective data.

### Browsing the Schema

On the right side, there is the documentation panel to expand and browse for all the requests and parameters you can use. See [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) for documentation on Queries and Mutations.&#x20;

### Making a Request

On the (top) left panel, you would enter in your request to be made to the Enjin Cloud. Press the `Play`button at the top to submit your request, and you will receive a response on the right panel. At times, a notification will appear in your wallet to sign a transaction depending on the request made.

_**Note:** You can now enable v.2 schemas on your project (Mainnet, JumpNet and/or Kovan). To do this, follow this guide_ [_here_](https://enjin.io/help/v2-schemas-beta-release)_._
