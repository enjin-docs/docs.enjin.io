## **Types of Beams**

#### Single-use QRs

Single-use QRs can be used for one-time claims of an individual asset.

An unique QR code will be generated for each individual asset you want to distribute. Once a single-use QR code is scanned, it is considered depleted and cannot be scanned again.

#### Multi-use QRs

Multi-use QRs can be used to distribute multiple assets using the same QR code. This allows you to create a single QR code to be displayed to a channel where multiple users are expected to scan the same QR code.

Multi-use QRs further branch into:

* **Airbeam: **All users receive the same blockchain asset.
* **Lootbeam: **A Lootbeam includes a variety of different blockchain assets and allows you to gamify the Beam experience. The chance of a user receiving an asset depends on the number of assets held in the smart contract; the fewer of an asset there is, the less likely a user is to receive it.

## Beam Parameters
