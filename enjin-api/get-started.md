# Getting Started

As you start, it's **very important** that all of your admin and user data is parsed and stored by a secure server.

This means** **you will need a solid understanding of our Cloud API (GraphQL) to complete your secure integration.&#x20;

If you haven't, we recommend going through the section "[What is GraphQL?](../core-api/using-graphql/)" and taking a look at our directory of all the available GraphQL queries and mutations to use:

{% content-ref url="../core-api/using-graphql/graphql-visual-interface.md" %}
[graphql-visual-interface.md](../core-api/using-graphql/graphql-visual-interface.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Step 1: Getting Your Bearer Token

The first step is acquiring your bearer token. You can log into your account via our API using the following query:

```graphql
query Login($email: String!, $password: String!) {
 EnjinOauth(email: $email, password: $password) {
   id
   name
   accessTokens
 }
}
```

### Step 2: Getting Your Secret Key

You will need to acquire your secret key by following this query:

```graphql
query GetAppSecret($id: Int!) {
 EnjinApps(id: $id){
   secret
 }
}
```

### Step 3: Getting Your Access Token

Once you have retrieved the app secret from the previous step, you will need the access token, which you can retrieve by following this query:

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to store your access token serverside!
{% endhint %}

```graphql
query RetrieveAppAccessToken($appId: Int!, $appSecret: String!) {
 AuthApp(id: $appId, secret: $appSecret) {
   accessToken
   expiresIn
 }
}
```
